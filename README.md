# Important Announcement

We’re rewriting our Unreal Engine integration to deliver significantly better performance, and it’s already showing a 4x speed boost.

To focus on this effort, we’re temporarily pausing support and no longer recommending the current version of the Rive x Unreal plugin, which was released as an experimental preview. If you’re evaluating Rive, the [Rive C++ Runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-runtime) is the best way to gauge our performance and stability.

Since we started working with Unreal Engine last year, we’ve learned a lot and made key hires with deep Unreal experience. This rewrite reflects that progress.

We’re sharing this now to be transparent, especially for teams considering Rive with Unreal Engine. A better, faster integration is on the way. We’ll share more technical details in an upcoming blog post.

# Rive Unreal Demos
 
This repo contains examples of how to use Rive in Unreal Engine. There are several levels included in the project, each showing a different way of using Rive. You can find the Rive documentation [here](https://rive.app/community/doc/introduction/docvphVOrBbl) and the Rive Unreal runtime section [here](https://rive.app/community/doc/unreal/docz17NbarFe).

Choose the branch that matches your version of Unreal. "Main" works with UE 5.5. Other versions have separate branches.
